# React-Native-ToDoApp

This is a simple Todo App built using React Native. It allows users to add, view, and delete their todos. The app provides a user-friendly interface to manage daily tasks efficiently.

## Features

- Add new todos: Users can add new tasks with a minimum of 4 characters.
- View todos: All added todos are displayed in a list.
- Delete todos: Users can delete completed or unnecessary tasks.
- Local Data Persistence
The app uses AsyncStorage for local data persistence. Todos are saved locally on the device using AsyncStorage, ensuring that the user's tasks are preserved even after restarting the app or closing and reopening it.
